# Elm + Quill with custom element example

Beware! This is just a proof of concept.
The API is weird and the component is not yet suitable for reuse.

## How to use

```
# builds elm code
$ ./script/build

# alternatively, builds elm code and watches for changes
$ ./script/watch

# does what it says on the can
$ open index.html
```
